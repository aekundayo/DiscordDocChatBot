        <p>Keep the user profile name ready for the first step of the following tutorial.</p>
     
        <h2 id="canvas-collaborate-share">Canvas users: Share a model with Studio users</h2>
        <p>Within the Canvas application, share your model version with Studio users or
            request feedback from them. You should use a model version that has been built; you
            canâ€™t share a model version that is a draft or currently building. You can only share
            one version per model.</p>
        <p>To share your Canvas model with Studio users, use the following procedure.</p>
        <div class="procedure"><ol><li><p>Open the SageMaker Canvas application.</p></li><li><p>From the <b>Models</b> page, select the model that you want to share. You can only share Standard build models.</p></li><li><p>In the header, choose <b>Share</b>.</p></li><li>
                <p>In the <b>Share Model</b> dialog box, do the following:</p>
                <ol><li>
                        <p>From the <b>Choose a model version to share</b> dropdown
                            list, select the model version for which you want feedback.</p>
                    </li><li>
                        <p>From the <b>SageMaker Studio users</b> dropdown list,
                            select Studio users by their profile names. You can add up to 23
                            Studio users.</p>
                    </li><li>
                        <p>For the <b>Add a note</b> field, you can enter a quick
                            note that accompanies your model when you send it to the Studio
                            users.</p>
                    </li><li><p>Choose <b>Share</b>.</p></li><li><p>In the <b>Share Model</b> confirmation box that appears, choose <b>Share</b>.</p></li></ol>
            </li></ol></div>
        <p>You have now shared your model with the Studio users, and the users receive a notification in Studio that a model has been shared with them.</p>
     
        <h2 id="canvas-collaborate-receive-studio">Studio users: Receive a model in Studio from Canvas users</h2>
        <p>In Studio, if a model has been shared with you, you receive a notification similar
            to the following when you open the Studio application.</p>
        <div class="mediaobject">
             
                <img src="../../../images/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/studio/canvas/sharing/studio-view-shared-model-banner.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;                Screenshot of the banner in Studio telling the user that a model has been shared with them.&#xA;            " style="max-width:80%" />
             
             
        </div>
        <p>Choose <b>View shared models</b> to open the <b>Shared models and
                notebooks</b> page in Studio. If you miss the notification, you can find
            the <b>Shared models and notebooks</b> page by doing the following:</p>
        <div class="procedure"><ol><li><p>Open your Amazon SageMaker Studio application.</p></li><li><p>In the side navigation pane, choose the <b>Home</b> icon (<span class="inlinemediaobject">

                </span>).</p></li><li><p>In the side navigation bar that opens, choose <b>Models</b>.</p></li><li><p>In the dropdown list, choose <b>Shared models</b> to open the <b>Shared models and notebooks</b> page.</p></li></ol></div>
        <p>On the <b>Shared models and notebooks</b> page, select the filter
                <b>Shared with me</b>. You should see the Canvas model that has
            been shared with you in the list of shared models. Choose <b>View
                model</b> on the shared model, which opens the model details page in Autopilot.
            The opened model should have a banner at the top that looks similar to the following
            screenshot.</p>
        <div class="mediaobject">
             
                <img src="../../../images/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/studio/canvas/sharing/studio-from-canvas-banner.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;                Screenshot of the banner at the top of the model details page in Studio showing that the model was shared from SageMaker Canvas.&#xA;            " style="max-width:80%" />
             
             
        </div>
        <p>From this page, you can see the model details, as well as any notes about the model shared with you by the Canvas user.
            In the Canvas banner at the top, you can choose the following actions:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
             
             
             
        <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Share feedback with the Canvas user.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make updates to the shared model and share the updates with the Canvas user.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Share an alternate version of the model with the Canvas user. Canvas uses
                <a href="autopilot-automate-model-development.html">Autopilot</a>
                to train multiple versions of the model and select the best version. You can select a different version if you decide that itâ€™s better for your use case.</p></li></ul></div>
        <p>For more information on the preceding actions, see the following sections.</p>
        
         
            <h3 id="canvas-collaborate-receive-studio-share-feedback">Share feedback</h3>
            <p>You might want to send a comment or feedback to the Canvas user without making any changes to the model.</p>
            <p>To share feedback on the shared model, use the following procedure:</p>
            <div class="procedure"><ol><li><p>On the model details page, choose <b>Share feedback</b>.</p></li><li><p>In the <b>Share feedback</b> dialog box, add a note in the <b>Add feedback</b> field.</p></li><li><p>Choose <b>Share</b> to send the feedback to the Canvas user.</p></li></ol></div>
            <p>After giving feedback, you can view the feedback you sent in the Canvas banner
                at the top of the model details page. The Canvas user receives the feedback in
                the Canvas application and can make changes based on your feedback.</p>
         
        
         
            <h3 id="canvas-collaborate-receive-studio-share-updates">Share an updated model with the Canvas user</h3>
            <p>You might want to make changes to the model that the Canvas user shared with you. For example, you might want to use advanced
                data transformations such as one-hot encoding to improve the accuracy of the model. You can update the model with
                <a href="data-wrangler.html">Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler</a> and
                <a href="autopilot-automate-model-development.html">Amazon SageMaker Autopilot</a> in Studio,
                which are features that help you make data transformations and train your model.</p>

                        Recall and Precision, and whether the new model improves the metrics or not.
                        Review the metrics and decide whether you would like to share the updated
                        model or not. For more information about Autopilot metrics, see <a href="autopilot-metrics-validation.html">Metrics and validation</a>.</p>

            <p>When SageMaker Canvas builds a model, Amazon SageMaker Autopilot trains multiple versions of the model and selects the best one.
                You might decide that an alternate version of the model is better according to your needs. You can share an alternate Autopilot version
                of the model with the Canvas user instead of making changes to the one they sent. For more information about Autopilot, see the
                <a href="autopilot-automate-model-development.html">Autopilot documentation</a>.</p>
            <p>To share an alternate model, use the following procedure:</p>
            <div class="procedure"><ol><li><p>On the model details page, in the Canvas banner, choose <b>Update model</b>.</p></li><li><p>In the bannerâ€™s dropdown list, choose <b>Recommend an alternate Auto ML

                        you're ready to share an alternate version, in the Canvas banner at the

                    <p>In the <b>Share</b> dialog box, do the following:</p>
                    <ol><li>
                            <p>For the <b>Select a model to share</b> dropdown list, the best model from the Autopilot experiment is selected and marked
