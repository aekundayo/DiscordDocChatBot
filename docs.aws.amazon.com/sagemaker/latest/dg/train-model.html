        training dataset to generating a final model and selecting the best performing model for
        deployment. The following sections provide an overview of available SageMaker training features
        and resources with in-depth technical information for each.</p>
        <h2 id="train-model-simple-case">The simplest training workflow in SageMaker</h2>
        <p>If youâ€™re using SageMaker for the first time and want to find a quick ML solution to train
            a model on your dataset, consider using a no-code or low-code solution such as <a href="canvas.html"> SageMaker Canvas</a>, <a href="studio-jumpstart.html">SageMaker JumpStart
                within SageMaker Studio</a>, or <a href="autopilot-automate-model-development.html">SageMaker
                Autopilot</a>.</p>
        <p>For intermediate coding experiences, consider using a <a href="notebooks.html">SageMaker Studio notebook</a> or <a href="nbi.html">SageMaker Notebook
                Instances</a>. To get started, follow the instructions at <a href="ex1-train-model.html">Step 4: Train a Model</a> of the SageMaker <em>Getting
                Started</em> guide. We recommend this for use cases in which you create your
            own model and training script using an ML framework. </p>
        <p>The following architecture diagram shows how SageMaker manages ML training jobs and
            provisions Amazon EC2 instances on behalf of SageMaker users. You as a SageMaker user can bring your
            own training dataset, saving it to Amazon S3. You can choose an ML model training from
            available SageMaker built-in algorithms, or bring your own training script with a model built
            with popular machine learning frameworks.</p>

        <p>The full journey of ML training involves tasks beyond data ingestion to ML models,
            training models on compute instances, and obtaining model artifacts and outputs. You
            need to evaluate every phase of before, during, and after training to make sure your
            model is trained well to meet the target accuracy for your objectives.</p>
        <p>The following flow chart shows a high-level overview of your actions (in blue boxes)
            and available SageMaker Training features (in light blue boxes) throughout the training phase
            of the ML lifecycle.</p>

Optionally, you can use&#xA;                    augmented manifest files to pipe in your data and analyze is for bias. During&#xA;                    training, you must set up infrastructure and evaluate your model. You can&#xA;                    optionally set up distributed training to run parallel jobs, use SageMaker&#xA;                    Experiments to manage your ML trials. After model evaluation, you can use SageMaker&#xA;                    automatic model tuning to optimize model performance. For deep learning jobs,&#xA;                    you might want to consider using Amazon SageMaker Debugger and SageMaker Training Compiler to optimize your jobs. After&#xA;                    training, you must first obtain the baseline model. Next, you can analyze the&#xA;                    metrics emitted by the model and use CloudWatch Metrics to set alerts. After you&#xA;                    obtain your model predictions, you can also use Amazon SageMaker Clarify to analyze your model&#xA;                    and data for bias and explainability.&#xA;            " style="max-width:100%" />
