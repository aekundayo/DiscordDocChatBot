    inference. This task involves induction as it uses data to train algorithms to make
    generalizable inferences. This means that the algorithms can make statistically reliable
    predictions or decisions, or complete other tasks when applied to new data that was not used to
    train them. </p><p>To help you select the best algorithm for your task, we classify these tasks on various
    levels of abstraction. At the highest level of abstraction, machine learning attempts to find
    patterns or relationships between features or less structured items, such as text in a data set.
    Pattern recognition techniques can be classified into distinct machine learning paradigms, each
    of which address specific problem types. There are currently three basic paradigms for machine
    learning used to address various problem types: </p><div class="itemizedlist">

    </li></ul></div><p>The types of problems that each learning paradigm can address are identified by considering
    the inferences (or predictions, decisions, or other tasks) you want to make from the type of
    data that you have or could collect. Machine learning paradigms use algorithmic methods to
    address their various problem types. The algorithms provide recipes for solving these problems. </p><p>However, many algorithms, such as neural networks, can be deployed with different learning
    paradigms and on different types of problems. Multiple algorithms can also address a specific
    problem type. Some algorithms are more generally applicable and others are quite specific for
    certain kinds of objectives and data. So the mapping between machine learning algorithms and
    problem types is many-to-many. Also, there are various implementation options available for
    algorithms. </p><p>The following sections provide guidance concerning implementation options, machine learning
    paradigms, and algorithms appropriate for different problem types.</p><div class="highlights"><h6>Topics</h6><ul><li><a href="algorithms-choose.html#algorithms-choose-implementation">Choose an algorithm implementation</a></li><li><a href="algorithms-choose.html#basic-machine-learning-paradigms">Problem types for the basic machine

      <h3 id="built-in-algorithms-benefits">Use a built-in algorithm</h3>
      <p>When choosing an algorithm for your type of problem and data, the easiest option is to
        use one of Amazon SageMaker's built-in algorithms. These built-in algorithms come with two major
        benefits.</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
         
         
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
          <p>The built-in algorithms require no coding to start running experiments. The only
            inputs you need to provide are the data, hyperparameters, and compute resources. This
            allows you to run experiments more quickly, with less overhead for tracking results and
            code changes.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>The built-in algorithms come with parallelization across multiple compute instances
            and GPU support right out of the box for all applicable algorithms (some algorithms may
            not be included due to inherent limitations). If you have a lot of data with which to
            train your model, most built-in algorithms can easily scale to meet the demand. Even if
            you already have a pre-trained model, it may still be easier to use its corollary in
            SageMaker and input the hyper-parameters you already know than to port it over, using script
            mode on a supported framework.</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p>For more information on the built-in algorithms provided by SageMaker, see <a href="algos.html">Use Amazon SageMaker Built-in Algorithms or Pre-trained Models</a>.</p>
      <p>For important information about docker registry paths, data formats, recommended EC2
        instance types, and CloudWatch logs common to all of the built-in algorithms provided by SageMaker,
        see <a href="common-info-all-im-models.html">Common Information About Built-in
                Algorithms</a>.</p>
     
     
      <h3 id="supported-frameworks-benefits">Use script mode in a supported
          framework</h3>
      <p>If the algorithm you want to use for your model is not supported by a built-in choice
        and you are comfortable coding your own solution, then you should consider using an Amazon SageMaker
        supported framework. This is referred to as "script mode" because you write your custom code
        (script) in a text file with a <code>.py</code> extension. As the table above
        indicates, SageMaker supports most of the popular machine learning frameworks. These frameworks
        come preloaded with the corresponding framework and some additional Python packages, such as
        Pandas and NumPy, so you can write your own code for training an algorithm. These frameworks
        also allow you to install any Python package hosted on PyPi by including a requirements.txt
        file with your training code or to include your own code directories. R is also supported
        natively in SageMaker notebook kernels. Some frameworks, like scikit-learn and Spark ML, have
        pre-coded algorithms you can use easily, while other frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch
        may require you to implement the algorithm yourself. The only limitation when using a
        supported framework image is that you cannot import any software packages that are not
        hosted on PyPi or that are not already included with the framework’s image.</p>
      <p>For more information on the frameworks supported by SageMaker, see <a href="frameworks.html">Machine Learning Frameworks and Languages</a>.</p>
     
     
      <h3 id="custom-image-use-case">Use a custom Docker image</h3>
      <p>Amazon SageMaker's built-in algorithms and supported frameworks should cover most use cases, but
        there are times when you may need to use an algorithm from a package not included in any of
        the supported frameworks. You might also have a pre-trained model picked or persisted
        somewhere which you need to deploy. SageMaker uses Docker images to host the training and serving
        of all models, so you can supply your own custom Docker image if the package or software you
        need is not included in a supported framework. This may be your own Python package or an
        algorithm coded in a language like Stan or Julia. For these images you must also configure
        the training of the algorithm and serving of the model properly in your Dockerfile. This
        requires intermediate knowledge of Docker and is not recommended unless you are comfortable
        writing your own machine learning algorithm. Your Docker image must be uploaded to an online
        repository, such as the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) before you can train and serve your model
        properly.</p>

            results of diagnostic tests is an example of binary classification.</p>

          <p><b>Multiclass classification</b> is a type of supervised
            learning that assigns an individual to one of several classes based on the individual's
            attributes. It is supervised because the models are trained using examples in which the
            attributes are provided with correctly labeled objects. An example is the prediction of
            the topic most relevant to a text document. A document may be classified as being about
            religion, politics, or finance, or as about one of several other predefined topic
            classes.</p>

      <p>If the target values you are trying to predict are mathematically continuous, then you
        have a <b>regression</b> problem. Regression estimates the values
        of a dependent target variable based on one or more other variables or attributes that are
        correlated with it. An example is the prediction of house prices using features like the
        number of bathrooms and bedrooms and the square footage of the house and garden. Regression
        analysis can create a model that takes one or more of these features as an input and
        predicts the price of a house.</p>

      <h3 id="algorithms-choose-unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised learning</h3>
      <p>If your data set consists of features or attributes (inputs) that do not contain labels
        or target values (outputs), then you have an unsupervised learning problem. In this type of
        problem, the output must be predicted based on the pattern discovered in the input data. The
        goal in unsupervised learning problems is to discover patterns such as groupings within the
        data. There are a large variety of tasks or problem types to which unsupervised learning can
        be applied. Principal component and cluster analyses are two of the main methods commonly
        deployed for preprocessing data. Here is a short list of problem types that can be addressed
        by unsupervised learning:</p>

          <p><b>Dimension reduction</b> is typically part of a data
            exploration step used to determine the most relevant features to use for model
            construction. The idea is to transform data from a high-dimensional, sparsely populated
            space into a low-dimensional space that retains most significant properties of the
            original data. This provides relief for the curse of dimensionality that can arise with
            sparsely populated, high-dimensional data on which statistical analysis becomes
            problematic. It can also be used to help understand data, reducing high-dimensional data
            to a lower dimensionality that can be visualized.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><b>Cluster analysis</b> is a class of techniques that are
            used to classify objects or cases into groups called clusters. It attempts to find
            discrete groupings within data, where members of a group are as similar as possible to
            one another and as different as possible from members of other groups. You define the
            features or attributes that you want the algorithm to use to determine similarity,
            select a distance function to measure similarity, and specify the number of clusters to
            use in the analysis.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><b>Anomaly detection</b> is the identification of rare
            items, events, or observations in a data set which raise suspicions because they differ
            significantly from the rest of the data. The identification of anomalous items can be
            used, for example, to detect bank fraud or medical errors. Anomalies are also referred
            to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations, and exceptions.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><b>Density estimation</b> is the construction of estimates
            of unobservable underlying probability density functions based on observed data. A
            natural use of density estimates is for data exploration. Density estimates can discover
            features such as skewness and multimodality in the data. The most basic form of density
            estimation is a rescaled histogram.</p>

      <h3 id="algorithms-choose-reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement learning</h3>
      <p>Reinforcement learning is a type of learning that is based on interaction with the
        environment. This type of learning is used by an agent that must learn behavior through
        trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment in which the goal is to maximize the
        long-term rewards that the agent receives as a result of its actions. Rewards are maximized
        by trading off exploring actions that have uncertain rewards with exploiting actions that
        have known rewards. </p>
