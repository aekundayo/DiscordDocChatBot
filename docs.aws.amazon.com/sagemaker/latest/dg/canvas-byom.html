You can't share time series models.
  Also, Canvas bring your own model (BYOM) only supports CPU-based models (or models that use CPU instances to make predictions).</p></div></div><p>Business analysts can benefit from ML models already built by data scientists to solve
  business problems instead of creating a new model in Amazon SageMaker Canvas. However, it might be difficult to
  use these models outside the environments in which they are built due to technical requirements,
  rigidity of tools, and manual processes to import models. This often forces users to rebuild ML
  models, resulting in the duplication of effort and additional time and resources.</p><p>SageMaker Canvas removes these limitations so you can generate predictions in Canvas with models
  that you’ve trained anywhere. You can register ML models in <a href="model-registry.html">SageMaker Model Registry</a>, which is a metadata
  store for ML models, and import them into SageMaker Canvas. Additionally, you can generate predictions with
  models that data scientists have trained in Amazon SageMaker Autopilot or SageMaker JumpStart. Canvas users can then analyze and generate predictions from any model
  that has been shared with them.</p><p>After you’ve satisfied the <a href="canvas-byom.html#canvas-byom-prereqs">Prerequisites</a>,
  see the following sections for instructions on how to bring your own models into
  Canvas and generate predictions. The workflow begins in Studio, where a Studio user shares a model with a Canvas user.
  Then, the Canvas user signs in to their Canvas app to receive the shared model and generate predictions with it.</p><div class="awsdocs-note awsdocs-important"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-warning" variant="error"></awsui-icon><h6>Important</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>You can only share models trained with tabular data.

  <h2 id="canvas-byom-prereqs">Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>To bring your model into SageMaker Canvas, complete the following prerequisites:</p>
  <div class="itemizedlist">
    
    
    
    
  <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>You must have a Amazon SageMaker Studio user who has onboarded to Amazon SageMaker Domain. The Studio user
     must be in the same Domain as the Canvas user. Model sharing occurs when a Studio
     user shares a model with a Canvas user from within Studio. If you don’t already have a
     Studio user set up, see the <a href="studio.html">Studio documentation</a> and <a href="gs-studio-onboard.html">Onboard to
      Amazon SageMaker Domain</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You must have a trained model from SageMaker Autopilot, SageMaker JumpStart, or SageMaker Model Registry. For any model that you’ve built outside of SageMaker, you must register your model in Model Registry before importing it
    into Canvas. For more information, see the <a href="model-registry.html">Model Registry documentation</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The Canvas user with whom you want to share your model must have permission to access the
     Amazon S3 bucket in which you store your datasets and model artifacts. For instructions on how
     admins can give Canvas users the permissions they need, see <a href="canvas-collaborate-permissions.html">Grant Users Permissions to Collaborate with
    Studio</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem">
    <p>You should also have the user profile name of the Canvas user with whom you want to
     collaborate. The Canvas user must be in the same Amazon SageMaker Domain as your Studio user.
     You can find a user’s profile name by using the following procedure:</p>
    <div class="procedure"><ol><li><p>Open the SageMaker console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.</p></li><li><p>In the navigation panel, choose <b>Domains</b>.</p></li><li><p>From the list of <b>Domains</b>, choose your Domain. This opens the
      <b>Domain details</b> page, where you can find all of the <b>User profiles</b> for the Domain.</p></li></ol></div>
    <p>Keep the user profile name ready for the first step of the following tutorial.</p>
   </li></ul></div>
  <p>If your SageMaker Canvas app is running in a private customer VPC, any Autopilot models shared from Studio
   must use Autopilot HPO mode to support generating predictions in Canvas. For more information
   about HPO mode, see <a href="autopilot-model-support-validation.html">Training modes and algorithm
    support</a> in the Autopilot documentation.</p>

     For more information about the <b>Shared models and notebooks</b> page, see the
     <a href="jumpstart-content-sharing.html">Shared models and notebooks documentation</a>.</p><p>The following example walks you through sharing an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot model, but you can use the
     sharing feature on the <b>Shared models and notebooks</b> page to share models
     from any of the other features in the previous sections, such as Jumpstart and Model
     Registry.</p><p>To share an Autopilot model from the <b>Shared models and notebooks</b> page, use the following procedure.</p><div class="procedure"><ol><li><p>Open your Amazon SageMaker Studio application.</p></li><li><p>In the side navigation pane, choose the <b>Home</b> icon (<span class="inlinemediaobject">
      <img src="../../../images/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/studio/icons/house.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-xs-padding" alt="Home icon in Studio" />
      </span>).</p></li><li><p>In the side navigation bar of Studio, choose <b>Models</b>.</p></li><li><p>In the dropdown list, choose <b>Shared models</b> to open the <b>Shared models and notebooks</b> page.</p></li><li><p>Choose the filter icon, and in the <b>Shared from</b> dropdown list, choose <b>Autopilot</b>.</p></li><li><p>Select the Autopilot model from the list that you want to share with the Canvas user. You can only share one model at a time.
      Alternatively, you can select the model to open the model details page.</p></li><li><p>From either the Autopilot jobs page or the model details page, choose <b>Share</b>.</p></li><li>
      <p>In the <b>Share model</b> dialog box, do the following:</p>
      <ol><li><p>For the <b>Add Canvas users to share</b> field, enter the
         Canvas user’s profile name. You can enter up to 23 Canvas users. If a user profile
         you specify doesn’t have a Canvas app associated with it, you can't enter the profile
         name.</p></li><li><p>For the <b>Add a note</b> field, add a description or note for
         the Canvas user when they receive the model.</p></li><li><p>Choose <b>Share</b> to share the model.</p></li></ol>
     </li></ol></div><p>You have now shared the model with the Canvas user.</p></awsui-expandable-section></div>
  
  <p>After you share the model, you receive a notification popup in Studio similar to the
   following screenshot.</p>
  <div class="mediaobject">
    
    <img src="../../../images/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/studio/canvas/sharing/studio-shared-successfully.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;    Screenshot of the Studio notification that you shared a model successfully.&#xA;   " style="max-width:80%" />
    
    
  </div>
  <p>You can choose <b>View model</b> to open the <b>Shared models and notebooks</b> page in Studio.
   You can also view your shared models at any time from the <b>Shared models and notebooks</b> page.</p>
  <p>From this page, you can see the models that you’ve shared with the Canvas user under the <b>Shared by me</b> label, as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
  <div class="mediaobject">
    
    <img src="../../../images/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/studio/canvas/sharing/studio-shared-by-me.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;    Screenshot of the Studio Shared models and notebooks page where you can view all of your shared models.&#xA;   " style="max-width:80%" />
    
    
  </div>
  <p>Models that you’ve shared to Canvas have text on the card similar to the following example:
    <code class="code">Shared to: 12 Canvas users</code>.</p>
  
  <h2 id="canvas-byom-receive">Canvas users: Receive a shared model in SageMaker Canvas</h2>
  <p>When a Studio user shares a model with a Canvas user, you receive a notification
   within the Canvas application that a Studio user has shared a model with you.</p>
  <p>In the Canvas application, the notification is similar to the following
   screenshot.</p>
  <div class="mediaobject">
    
    <img src="../../../images/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/studio/canvas/sharing/canvas-new-model-notification.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;    Screenshot of the notification message in the SageMaker Canvas application for a newly shared&#xA;     model.&#xA;   " style="max-width:80%" />
    
    
  </div>
  <p>You can choose <b>View update</b> to see the shared model, or you can go to
   the <b>Models</b> page in the Canvas application to discover all of the models
   that have been shared with you.</p>
  <div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>Canvas users can’t edit a model that has been shared with them by a Studio user.
    Models imported from Studio are view and predict only.</p></div></div>
  <p>A model that has been shared by a Studio user looks like the following card on the <b>Models</b> page.
   This is different from <a href="canvas-collaborate.html">Collaborate with data scientists</a>, where a Canvas user shares a model and a
   Studio user shares updates or feedback with the Canvas user.</p>
  <div class="mediaobject">

  </div>
  <p>The model import from Studio can take up to 20 minutes, during which the model shows as <b>Importing</b>.</p>
  <p>After importing the model, you can view its metrics and generate predictions with it. SageMaker Canvas uses
   <a href="serverless-endpoints.html">Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference</a> resources to generate model analysis
   and predictions for shared models. You might see costs associated with Serverless Inference in your AWS account.</p>
  <p>The following screenshot shows the <b>Analyze</b> tab in the Canvas
   application for a shared model, where you can evaluate the model accuracy and metrics. For more
   information, see <a href="canvas-evaluate-model.html">Evaluate Your Model's Performance in
            Amazon SageMaker Canvas</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The following screenshot shows the <b>Predict</b> tab, where you can generate predictions with the model.
   For more information on generating predictions in Canvas, see <a href="canvas-make-predictions.html">Make predictions for your data</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <p>On both the <b>Analyze</b> and <b>Predict</b> tabs, you can see the <b>Shared History</b> panel,
   which shows you the model versions and comments shared with you by Studio users.</p>
