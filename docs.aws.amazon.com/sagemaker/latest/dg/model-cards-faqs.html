            Amazon SageMaker Model Card.</p><div class="collapsible" data-expand-section="_collapse_all_"><awsui-expandable-section variant="container" header="Q. What is model risk?" id="model-cards-faqs-risk" expanded="false"><p>A: You can use models for a variety of business applications ranging from
                    predicting cyber attacks and approving loan applications to detecting the
                    category of an email. Each of these applications assumes a different level of
                    risk. For example, incorrectly detecting a cyber attack has much greater
                    business impact than incorrectly categorizing an email. Given these varied risk
                    profiles of a model, you can use model cards to provide a risk rating of
                        <code class="code">low</code>, <code class="code">medium</code>, or <code class="code">high</code> for a model. If
                    you don’t know the risk of your model, you can set the status to
                        <code class="code">unknown</code>. Customers are responsible for assigning the risk
                    profile for each model. Based on the risk rating, organizations may have
                    different rules in place for deploying those models to production. For more
                    information, see <a href="model-cards.html#model-cards-risk-rating">Risk ratings</a>.</p></awsui-expandable-section></div><div class="collapsible" data-expand-section="_collapse_all_"><awsui-expandable-section variant="container" header="Q. What is the intended use of a&#xA;                        model?" id="model-cards-faqs-intended-use" expanded="false"><p>The intended use of a model describes how you should use the model in your
                    production applications. This goes beyond technical requirements like the type
                    of instance to which you should deploy a model and instead refers to the types
                    of applications to create with the model, the scenarios in which you can expect
                    a reasonable performance from the model, or the type of data to use with the
                    model. We recommend providing this information in the model card for better
                    model governance. You can define a kind of model specification in the intended
                    use field and ensure that model developers and consumers follow this
                    specification while training and deploying their models. For more information,
                    see <a href="model-cards.html#model-cards-intended-uses">Intended uses of a model</a>.</p></awsui-expandable-section></div><div class="collapsible" data-expand-section="_collapse_all_"><awsui-expandable-section variant="container" header="Q. Does SageMaker autopopulate&#xA;                        information in my model card?" id="model-cards-faqs-autopopulate" expanded="false"><p>When you use the SageMaker Python SDK or the AWS console to create your model
                    card, SageMaker autopopulates details about your SageMaker trained model in the card. This
                    includes details about how the model was trained along with all the model
                    details returned by the <code class="code">describe-model</code> API call.</p></awsui-expandable-section></div><div class="collapsible" data-expand-section="_collapse_all_"><awsui-expandable-section variant="container" header="Q. Can I customize a model&#xA;                        card?" id="model-cards-faqs-customize" expanded="false"><p>Amazon SageMaker Model Cards have a defined structure to them that cannot be modified. This
                    structure gives you guidance on what information should be captured in a model
                    card. While you cannot change the structure of the model card, there is some
                    flexibility introduced through custom properties in the <b>Additional
                        information</b> section of the model card. </p></awsui-expandable-section></div><div class="collapsible" data-expand-section="_collapse_all_"><awsui-expandable-section variant="container" header="Q. Can I edit a model card once it is&#xA;                        created?" id="model-cards-faqs-edit" expanded="false"><p>Model cards have versions associated with them. A given model version is
                    immutable across all attributes other than the model card status. If you make
                    any other changes to the model card, such as evaluation metrics, description, or
                    intended uses, SageMaker creates a new version of the model card to reflect the
                    updated information. This is to ensure that a model card, once created, cannot
                    be tampered with.</p></awsui-expandable-section></div><div class="collapsible" data-expand-section="_collapse_all_"><awsui-expandable-section variant="container" header="Q. Can I create model cards&#xA;                        for models that were not trained using SageMaker?" id="model-cards-faqs-external-models" expanded="false"><p>A: Yes. You can create model cards for models not trained in SageMaker, but no
                    information is automatically populated in the card. You must supply all the
                    information needed in the model card for non-SageMaker models.</p></awsui-expandable-section></div><div class="collapsible" data-expand-section="_collapse_all_"><awsui-expandable-section variant="container" header="Q. Can I export or share model&#xA;                        cards?" id="model-cards-faqs-export" expanded="false"><p>A: Yes. You can export each version of a model card to a PDF, downloaded, and
                    share it. </p></awsui-expandable-section></div><div class="collapsible" data-expand-section="_collapse_all_"><awsui-expandable-section variant="container" header="Q. Do I need to register my model in&#xA;                        the Model Registry to use model cards?" id="model-cards-faqs-registry" expanded="false"><p>A: No. You can use model cards independently of the Model Registry.</p></awsui-expandable-section></div><div class="collapsible" data-expand-section="_collapse_all_"><awsui-expandable-section variant="container" header="Q. What is the difference&#xA;                        between model cards and Model Registry?" id="model-cards-faqs-cards-vs-registry" expanded="false"><p>A: Model cards are intended to provide organizations with a mechanism to
                    document as much detail about their model as they like by following SageMaker’s
                    prescriptive guidance along with providing their own custom information. You can
                    introduce model cards at the very start of the ML process and use them to define
                    the business problem that the model should solve and any considerations to think
                    about while using the model. After a model is trained, you can populate the
                    model card associated with that model with information about the model and how
                    it was trained. Model cards are associated with models and are immutable once
                    associated with a model. This ensures that the model card is the single source
                    of truth for all the information related to a model, including how it was
                    trained and how it should be used.</p><p>The Model Registry is a catalog that stores metadata about your models. Each
                    entry in the model registry corresponds to a unique model version. That model
                    version contains information about the model such as where the model artifacts
                    are stored in Amazon S3, what container is needed to deploy the model,
                    and custom metadata that should be attached to the model. </p></awsui-expandable-section></div><div class="collapsible" data-expand-section="_collapse_all_"><awsui-expandable-section variant="container" header="Q. Are model card&#xA;                        versions related to model versions in the Model Registry?" id="model-cards-faqs-cards-vs-registry-versions" expanded="false"><p>A: Model card versions and model versions are different entities in SageMaker. Each
                    update to a model card results in a new version of that card. Model versions
                    correspond to incrementally trained models that are registered in the Model
                    Registry. A model card version may be linked to a specific model version in the
                    Model Registry by way of the model ID field in the model card, but this is not
                    necessary.</p></awsui-expandable-section></div><div class="collapsible" data-expand-section="_collapse_all_"><awsui-expandable-section variant="container" header="Q. Are model cards integrated&#xA;                        with SageMaker Model Monitor?" id="model-cards-faqs-model-monitor" expanded="false"><p>A: No. You can upload the performance metrics computed by SageMaker Model Monitor
                    to the model card by uploading a metrics file to Amazon S3 and linking
                    that to the card, but there is no native integration between Model Monitor and
                    model cards. Model dashboards are integrated with Model Monitor. For more
                    information on model dashboards, see <a href="model_dashboard.html">Amazon SageMaker Model Dashboard</a>.</p></awsui-expandable-section></div><awsdocs-copyright class="copyright-print"></awsdocs-copyright><awsdocs-thumb-feedback right-edge="{{$ctrl.thumbFeedbackRightEdge}}"></awsdocs-thumb-feedback></div><noscript><div><div><div><div id="js_error_message"><p><img src="https://d1ge0kk1l5kms0.cloudfront.net/images/G/01/webservices/console/warning.png" alt="Warning" /> <strong>Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.</strong></p><p>To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
