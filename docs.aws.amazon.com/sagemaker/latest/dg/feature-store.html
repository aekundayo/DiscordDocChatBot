    known as <em>features</em> from data to train ML models. Amazon SageMaker Feature Store
    makes it easy for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and general practitioners to
    create, share, and manage features for ML development. Feature Store accelerates this process by reducing
    repetitive data processing and curation work required to convert raw data into features for
    training an ML algorithm.</p><p>Further, the processing logic for your data is authored only once, and features generated
    are used for both training and inference, reducing the training-serving skew. Feature Store is a
    centralized store for features and associated metadata so features can be easily discovered and
    reused. You can create an online or an offline store. The online store is used for low latency
    real-time inference use cases, and the offline store is used for training and batch inference. Â  </p><p>The following diagram shows how you can use Feature Store as part of your machine learning pipeline.
    First, you read in your raw data and process it. You can ingest data via streaming to the online
    and offline store, or in batches directly to the offline store. You first create a
      <code class="code">FeatureGroup</code>Â  and configure it to an online or offline store, or both. Then, you
    can ingest data into your <code class="code">FeatureGroup</code> and store it in your store.Â A
      <code class="code">FeatureGroup</code>Â  is a group of features that is defined via a schema in Feature Store to
    describe a record.</p><p> Online store is primarily designed for supporting real-time predictions that need low
    millisecond latency reads and high throughput writes. Offline store is primarily intended for
    batch predictions and model training. Offline store is an append only store and can be used to
    store and access historical feature data. The offline store can help you store and serve
    features for exploration and model training. The online store retains only the latest feature
    data. Feature Groups are mutable and can evolve their schema after creation.</p><div class="mediaobject">

  </div>
    <h2 id="how-feature-store-works">How Feature Store works</h2>
    <p>In Feature Store, features are stored in a collection called a <em>feature
        group</em>.Â You can visualize a feature group as a table in which each column is a
      feature, with a unique identifier for each row. In principle, a feature group is composed of
      features and values specific to each feature. A <code class="code">Record</code> is a collection of values
      for features that correspond to a unique <code class="code">RecordIdentifier</code>. Altogether, a
        <code class="code">FeatureGroup</code> is a group of features defined in your <code class="code">FeatureStore</code>
      to describe a <code class="code">Record</code>.Â  </p>
    <p> You can use Feature Store inÂ the following modes:Â  </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
       
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p>
          <b>Online</b> â In online mode, features are read with
          low latency (milliseconds) reads and used for high throughput predictions. This mode
          requires a feature group to be stored in an online store.Â  </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
          <b>Offline</b> â In offline mode, large streams of data
          areÂ fed to an offline store, which can be used for training and batch inference. This mode
          requires a feature group to be stored in an offline store. The offline store uses your S3
          bucket for storage and can also fetch data using Athena queries.Â  </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
          <b>Online and Offline</b> â This includes both online and
          offline modes. </p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>You can ingest data into feature groups in Feature Store in two ways: streaming or in batches. When
      you ingest data through streaming, a collection of records are pushed to Feature Store by calling a
      synchronous <code class="code">PutRecord</code> API call. This API enables you to maintain the latest
      feature values in Feature Store and to push new feature values as soon an update is detected. </p>
    <p>Alternatively, Feature Store can process and ingest data in batches. You can author features using
      Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, create feature groups in Feature Store and ingest features in batches using a SageMaker Processing
      job with a notebook exported from Data Wrangler. This mode allows for batch ingestion into the offline
      store. It also supports ingestion into the online store if the feature group is configured for
      both online and offline use.Â  </p>
   
    <h2 id="create-feature-groups">Create feature groups</h2>

    <p>To ingest features into Feature Store, you must first define the feature group and the feature
      definitions (feature name and data type) for all features that belong to the feature group.
      After they are created, feature groups are mutable and can evolve their schema. Feature group
      names are unique within an AWS Region and AWS account. When creating a feature group, you
      can also create the metadata for the feature group, such as a short description, storage
      configuration, features for identifying each record, and the event time, as well as tags to
      store information such as the author, data source, version, and more. </p>
    <div class="awsdocs-note awsdocs-important"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-warning" variant="error"></awsui-icon><h6>Important</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p><code class="code">FeatureGroup</code> names or associated metadata such as description or tags
        should not contain any personal identifiable information (PII) or confidential information.
      </p></div></div>
   
    <h2 id="Find-discover-share-features">Find, discover, and share features</h2>

    <p>After you create a feature group in Feature Store, other authorized users of the feature store can
      share and discover it. Users can browse through a list of all feature groups in Feature Store or
      discover existing feature groups by searching by feature group name, description, record
      identifier name, creation date, and tags.Â  </p>
   
    <h2 id="real-time-inference">Real-time inference for features stored in the online
        storeÂ </h2>

    <p>With Feature Store, you can enrich your features stored in the online store in real time with data
      from a streaming source (clean stream data from another application) and serve the features
      with low millisecond latency for real-time inference.Â  </p>
    <p>You can also perform joins across different <code class="code">FeatureGroups</code> for real-time
      inference by querying two different <code class="code">FeatureGroups</code> in the client application.Â 
    </p>
   
    <h2 id="offline-store-for-model-training">Offline store for model training and batch
        inference</h2>

    <p>Feature Store provides offline storage for feature values in your S3 bucket. Your data is stored in
      your S3 bucket using a prefixing scheme based on event time.Â The offline store is an
      append-only store, enabling Feature Store to maintain a historical record of all feature values. Data
      is stored in the offline store in Parquet format for optimized storage and query
      access.</p>
    <p>You can query, explore, and visualize features using Data Wrangler from Amazon SageMaker Studio.Â  Feature Store
      supports combining data to produce, train, validate, and test data sets, and allows you to
      extract data at different points in time. </p>
   
    <h2 id="feature-data-ingestion">Feature data ingestion</h2>
    <p>Feature generation pipelines can be created to process large batches (1 million rows of
      data or more) or small batches, and to write feature data to the offline or online store.
      Streaming sources such as Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka or Amazon Kinesis can also be used as data sources from which
      features are extracted and directly fed to the online store for training, inference, or
      feature creation.Â  </p>
    <p>You can push records to Feature Store by calling the synchronous <code class="code">PutRecord</code> API call.
      Since this is a synchronous API call, it allows small batches of updates to be pushed in a
      single API call. This enables you to maintain high freshness of the feature values and publish
      values as soon as an update is detected. These are also called <em>streaming features</em>.Â </p>
    <p>When feature data is ingested and updated, Feature Store stores historical data for all features in
      the offline store. For batch ingest, you can pull feature values from your S3 bucket or use
      Athena to query. You can also use Data Wrangler to process and engineer new features that can then be
      exported to a chosen S3 bucket to be accessed by Feature Store. For batch ingestion, you can configure
      a processing job to batch ingest your data into Feature Store, or you can pull feature values from your
      S3 bucket using Athena.Â  </p>
    <p>To remove a <code class="code">Record</code> from your online store, use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_feature_store_DeleteRecord.html"><code class="code">DeleteRecord</code></a> API call. This will also add the deleted record to the
      offline store.</p>

   
    <h2 id="feature-store-resilience">Resilience in Feature Store</h2>
    <p>Feature Store is distributed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). An AZ is an isolated
      location within an AWS Region. If some AZs fail, Feature Store can use other AZs. For more
      information about AZs, see <a href="disaster-recovery-resiliency.html">Resilience in Amazon SageMaker</a>. </p>
