            points within a dataset. These are observations which diverge from otherwise
            well-structured or patterned data. Anomalies can manifest as unexpected spikes in time
            series data, breaks in periodicity, or unclassifiable data points. They are easy to
            describe in that, when viewed in a plot, they are often easily distinguishable from the
            "regular" data. Including these anomalies in a dataset can drastically increase the
            complexity of a machine learning task since the "regular" data can often be described
            with a simple model.</p><p>The main idea behind the RCF algorithm is to create a forest of trees where each tree
            is obtained using a partition of a sample of the training data. For example, a random
            sample of the input data is first determined. The random sample is then partitioned
            according to the number of trees in the forest. Each tree is given such a partition and
            organizes that subset of points into a k-d tree. The anomaly score assigned to a data
            point by the tree is defined as the expected change in complexity of the tree as a
            result adding that point to the tree; which, in approximation, is inversely proportional
            to the resulting depth of the point in the tree. The random cut forest assigns an
            anomaly score by computing the average score from each constituent tree and scaling the
            result with respect to the sample size. The RCF algorithm is based on the one described
            in reference [1].</p>
            <h2 id="rcf-rndm-sample-data">Sample Data Randomly </h2>
            <p>The first step in the RCF algorithm is to obtain a random sample of the training
                data. In particular, suppose we want a sample of size <span class="inlinemediaobject">

                entire dataset can be used, and we could randomly draw <span class="inlinemediaobject">

                is too large to fit all at once, and this approach isn't feasible. Instead, we use a
                technique called reservoir sampling.</p>

                </span> the algorithm is more complicated. Additionally, a distinction
                must be made between random sampling that is with and without replacement. RCF
                performs an augmented reservoir sampling without replacement on the training data
                based on the algorithms described in [2].</p>
         
            <h2 id="rcf-training-inference">Train a RCF Model and Produce Inferences</h2>

            <p>The next step in RCF is to construct a random cut forest using the random sample
                of data. First, the sample is partitioned into a number of equal-sized partitions
                equal to the number of trees in the forest. Then, each partition is sent to an
                individual tree. The tree recursively organizes its partition into a binary tree by
                partitioning the data domain into bounding boxes.</p>
            <p>This procedure is best illustrated with an example. Suppose a tree is given the
                following two-dimensional dataset. The corresponding tree is initialized to the root
                node:</p>
            <div class="mediaobject">
                 
                    <img src="../../../images/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/RCF1.jpg" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" />
                 
                <div class="caption">
                    <p>A two-dimensional dataset where the majority of data lies in a cluster
                        (blue) except for one anomalous data point (orange). The tree is initialized
                        with a root node.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The RCF algorithm organizes these data in a tree by first computing a bounding
                box of the data, selecting a random dimension (giving more weight to dimensions with
                higher "variance"), and then randomly determining the position of a hyperplane "cut"
                through that dimension. The two resulting subspaces define their own sub tree. In
                this example, the cut happens to separate a lone point from the remainder of the
                sample. The first level of the resulting binary tree consists of two nodes, one
                which will consist of the subtree of points to the left of the initial cut and the
                other representing the single point on the right.</p>
            <div class="mediaobject">
                 
                    <img src="../../../images/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/RCF2.jpg" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" />
                 
                <div class="caption">
                    <p>A random cut partitioning the two-dimensional dataset. An anomalous data
                        point is more likely to lie isolated in a bounding box at a smaller tree
                        depth than other points. </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Bounding boxes are then computed for the left and right halves of the data and the
                process is repeated until every leaf of the tree represents a single data point from
                the sample. Note that if the lone point is sufficiently far away then it is more
                likely that a random cut would result in point isolation. This observation provides
                the intuition that tree depth is, loosely speaking, inversely proportional to the
                anomaly score.</p>

            <p>When performing inference using a trained RCF model the final anomaly score is
                reported as the average across scores reported by each tree. Note that it is often
                the case that the new data point does not already reside in the tree. To determine
                the score associated with the new point the data point is inserted into the given
                tree and the tree is efficiently (and temporarily) reassembled in a manner
                equivalent to the training process described above. That is, the resulting tree is
                as if the input data point were a member of the sample used to construct the tree in
                the first place. The reported score is inversely proportional to the depth of the
                input point within the tree.</p>
         
            <h2 id="rcf-choose-hyperparam">Choose Hyperparameters</h2>

            <p>The primary hyperparameters used to tune the RCF model are <code class="code">num_trees</code>
                and <code class="code">num_samples_per_tree</code>. Increasing <code class="code">num_trees</code> has the
                effect of reducing the noise observed in anomaly scores since the final score is the
                average of the scores reported by each tree. While the optimal value is
                application-dependent we recommend using 100 trees to begin with as a balance
                between score noise and model complexity. Note that inference time is proportional
                to the number of trees. Although training time is also affected it is dominated by
                the reservoir sampling algorithm describe above.</p>

            <p>The parameter <code class="code">num_samples_per_tree</code> is related to the expected density
                of anomalies in the dataset. In particular, <code class="code">num_samples_per_tree</code> should
                be chosen such that <code class="code">1/num_samples_per_tree</code> approximates the ratio of
                anomalous data to normal data. For example, if 256 samples are used in each tree
                then we expect our data to contain anomalies 1/256 or approximately 0.4% of the
                time. Again, an optimal value for this hyperparameter is dependent on the
                application.</p>
